09:48,09:49,SPEAKER_01,Allow it.
09:49,09:51,SPEAKER_01,Allow değil.
09:51,09:52,Unknown,Understood.
09:52,09:56,SPEAKER_02,"I mean there won't be any records, really no customer?"
09:56,09:57,SPEAKER_02,There will be.
09:57,09:59,SPEAKER_02,"Yes, yes."
09:59,10:00,SPEAKER_02,Yes.
10:00,10:01,SPEAKER_01,Excellent.
10:00,10:04,SPEAKER_01,Sure there will be no record because you do not know which account is there or anything.
10:04,10:11,SPEAKER_04,Business team understood. Business team to send the consolidated report to the SMS team.
10:11,10:16,SPEAKER_01,"Yes, to us. Send the report to us. Yeah, we will send it to you but with the."
10:16,10:21,SPEAKER_04,Content that you know you have to send the consolidated email to the SMS team.
10:21,10:28,SPEAKER_04,"Yes, correct. Okay, got it. And any other check as part of this one?"
10:28,10:35,SPEAKER_01,"No. No checks? No checks. Okay, after that once you send the communication."
10:35,10:41,SPEAKER_01,"Exactly after 60 calendar days. 60 calendar days, okay. Yes, after 60 calendar days."
10:41,10:49,SPEAKER_01,There should be alert that account is due for closure. Again a reminder mail?
10:49,10:57,SPEAKER_03,"Yes. Reminder mail, what is that reminder mail?"
10:57,11:01,SPEAKER_01,Reminder mail accounts are due for closure for foreign border checks.
11:01,11:08,SPEAKER_04,"Accounts are due for courier? Courier, courier. For closing purpose."
11:08,11:14,SPEAKER_01,"See, once we are communicating with the customer, we will wait for 60 days."
11:14,11:21,SPEAKER_04,"Okay. After 60 days we will close the account. Oh, okay. So, how are you telling that."
11:21,11:31,SPEAKER_04,"Accounts are due for? Closure. Closure, okay, got it. Reminder mail will be sent to you."
11:31,11:37,SPEAKER_04,Got it. This has to be done after 60 calendar days. Got it. Okay. Correct.
11:37,11:55,SPEAKER_02,Anything else? One second. This is something else.
11:56,12:03,SPEAKER_01,"So, you are saying something closer to me or? Is it okay, is it enough for account closure."
12:03,12:09,SPEAKER_00,"Or something else you want to add? For account closure, these many checks are okay, right,."
12:09,12:16,SPEAKER_04,"From your side, from the business side. Yeah. I have one doubt here. So, after 60 days."
12:17,12:27,SPEAKER_04,"You are telling, right, after 60 days, okay, but so it has to be like for example, let me take May 1,."
12:27,12:33,SPEAKER_04,"It's like May 1, we will have to send you all the account information which has to be closed."
12:33,12:39,SPEAKER_04,"Correct. After 10th, like 10th, you will have to get a reminder mail, correct? Yes."
12:40,12:49,SPEAKER_04,"So, then 60 days meaning, from 10th, 60 days or from like 1, 60 days? 60 days, not 1, 60, 6, 0."
12:49,12:55,SPEAKER_01,"No, no, no, from the date 1 or? From 10th, from the sending of message. Got it."
12:55,13:00,SPEAKER_01,"From day 11, from day 11, you can say. Right, from here, then 60 days probably it will,."
13:00,13:06,SPEAKER_04,"May, then June will complete and then by July 10, you will want a reminder for this one."
13:06,13:14,SPEAKER_04,"Yes. For the mail that was sent. Account closing. June. So, similarly, like it's like for every,."
13:14,13:22,SPEAKER_04,"Can we fix like this, every month on 10th, we will have to send you a reminder mail, you know,."
13:22,13:29,SPEAKER_04,"Telling that you need to close this. How does this work? Madhu, Madhu, I will explain to you."
13:30,13:38,SPEAKER_01,"For example, I am telling you one thing. Today, like this month, last month, last month, June,."
13:38,13:43,SPEAKER_01,"When the day started, day starts from Sunday. Sunday is not a working day. Okay."
13:43,13:49,SPEAKER_01,"So, here, the alert will be generated on 2nd. The working day is Monday. Okay."
13:49,13:58,SPEAKER_01,"So, today, if it's 2nd, if you will share with the business on the 2nd, then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10."
13:58,14:06,SPEAKER_01,"11th will be the 10 days. Understood. Correct? So, the 12th, you will receive the reminder."
14:06,14:15,SPEAKER_01,That it is due for the SMS notification. Got it. Okay. It is due for the SMS notification.
14:16,14:21,SPEAKER_01,"So, 12th. So, from 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, half-way to 16th is completed."
14:21,14:28,SPEAKER_01,"So, on the 16th, 61st day, you will remind us that account is due for clear."
14:28,14:35,SPEAKER_04,"Understood. So, the thing is, in between this timeline, there will be 2 more requests coming in, right?"
14:35,14:42,SPEAKER_04,"Yes. So, this request, but after 16th, it has to be, it has to be referring to…."
14:42,14:45,SPEAKER_04,For the month of June. You have decided the September month of June.
14:45,14:52,SPEAKER_04,"Got it. Understood. Yeah, this is what I wanted to understand."
14:52,14:54,SPEAKER_04,Yes. For the month of June.
14:54,15:03,SPEAKER_04,"Understood. Yeah, we will, maybe we will give a request ID and then, you know, mention that, you know, this one has to be done."
15:03,15:05,SPEAKER_04,"Like that, we will… Yeah, yeah."
15:05,15:09,SPEAKER_04,"Understood. Understood. So, that is all, right?"
15:09,15:16,SPEAKER_04,"So, it is like one, one, one mail with the anomalies, like the list of anomalies and then, two reminder mails."
15:16,15:18,SPEAKER_01,"Yes, correct. Okay."
15:21,15:23,SPEAKER_04,Okay. Can we go to the next one?
15:23,15:26,SPEAKER_01,"Next one, yes. Can you please minimize this one, this name?"
15:26,15:27,SPEAKER_01,Sure.
15:30,15:32,SPEAKER_01,"Remove this number, please, also."
15:32,15:33,SPEAKER_01,This one?
15:34,15:36,SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, here, the account maintenance."
15:36,15:47,SPEAKER_01,"If any changes happen, it is done on the name is fully got changed, EID number fully got changed, date of birth is fully got changed."
15:47,15:52,SPEAKER_01,"In case of non-resident, number is still available."
15:52,15:55,SPEAKER_01,"In case of non-resident, EID number is still available."
15:55,15:58,SPEAKER_01,"In case of non-resident, EID not got updated."
15:58,16:00,SPEAKER_01,"In case of resident, AMOC ID not got updated."
16:00,16:09,SPEAKER_01,"So, each this request, once the request is got completed on the BPM, the next day, we will receive this alerts."
16:09,16:17,SPEAKER_01,"Then, these are the names, where the name is fully got changed or the EID number is got changed or date of birth is got changed."
16:20,16:25,SPEAKER_04,"Okay. I mean, you want to have the list of all the requests that is coming in the BPM?"
16:25,16:26,SPEAKER_04,Yes.
16:26,16:28,SPEAKER_04,What do you mean it is not completed like that?
16:28,16:34,SPEAKER_01,"No, it is coming, it is completed in the month. Any changes done on the name? Any changes done on the date of birth?"
16:34,16:37,SPEAKER_00,"This is not from BPM, Madhu."
16:37,16:38,SPEAKER_00,From the ethics?
16:38,16:44,SPEAKER_00,"This is from ethics. So, basically, let us say, you have a third name, which is there, Nadeep, okay?"
16:44,16:45,SPEAKER_00,Okay.
16:46,16:54,SPEAKER_00,"By mistake or oversight, somebody or some of the team have changed your name from Madhusree to something else."
16:54,16:55,SPEAKER_01,Okay.
16:55,17:00,SPEAKER_00,"Or somebody have changed your MRIC ID number, which is your band number, let us say."
17:00,17:04,SPEAKER_00,"Then, they have entirely changed your date of birth or your residency."
17:04,17:09,SPEAKER_00,You are resident before in UAE and you became non-resident.
17:09,17:12,SPEAKER_00,"That means, your MRIC ID is invalid. So, that has to be removed."
17:12,17:17,SPEAKER_00,"If it is still present, then that should come as an alert as well or vice versa."
17:17,17:20,SPEAKER_00,"So, these all items, we are putting as a checkpoint."
17:20,17:24,SPEAKER_00,This is not a request coming out from BPM.
17:24,17:27,SPEAKER_00,This is a sole scenario what is happening in ethics.
17:27,17:36,SPEAKER_00,"Based on some action happening in surrounding system, it could be from BPM, it could be directly happening in ethics due to some access issue."
17:37,17:39,SPEAKER_00,What is the scenario?
17:39,17:41,SPEAKER_04,All understood.
17:41,17:43,SPEAKER_04,"Okay, got it."
17:43,17:46,SPEAKER_04,"And one more thing, what is this?"
17:46,17:51,SPEAKER_04,"Change should be happening in these ways, okay?"
17:51,17:55,SPEAKER_04,What is this in case of non-resident EID number is still available?
17:55,17:57,SPEAKER_00,That is what I told you.
17:57,18:00,SPEAKER_00,"Let us say, you were previously a resident of UAE."
18:00,18:04,SPEAKER_00,"That means, MRIC ID number will be registered for you, right?"
18:04,18:09,SPEAKER_00,"So, once you are moving out of UAE, cancelling your residency and stuff."
18:09,18:13,SPEAKER_00,"Then, as an ADI BAM, we are receiving the request."
18:13,18:20,SPEAKER_00,"If they are changing your resident seat and non-resident, then they are liable to change or remove your MRIC ID from that field itself."
18:20,18:27,SPEAKER_00,"If it is still present while you are being a non-resident, then some incorrect parameters are available in system itself."
18:27,18:29,SPEAKER_00,Okay.
18:29,18:39,SPEAKER_04,"So, should we directly check in the ethics system or should we track the request coming into the system and from there should we check?"
18:39,18:41,SPEAKER_00,"No, directly in ethics."
18:41,18:42,SPEAKER_00,Okay.
18:42,18:48,SPEAKER_04,"Then, say for example, directly in ethics, it will be like, say for my name Madhushri, it will be tagged to non-resident."
18:48,18:54,SPEAKER_04,"I will have to, all the customers who are tagged to non-resident will verify if the EID number is there or not."
18:54,18:55,SPEAKER_00,"Correct, correct."
18:55,19:03,SPEAKER_00,"If it is there, then you should get an alert saying that these many customers are new resident while MRIC ID is being available in the system."
19:03,19:06,SPEAKER_04,"That scenario is also possible, is it?"
19:06,19:08,SPEAKER_00,"Yeah, it is possible."
19:08,19:21,SPEAKER_04,"My question is, when it is getting changed to non-resident, then still EID number would have been, by mistake, will it be available?"
19:21,19:29,SPEAKER_00,"Yeah, by mistake. Ideally, when they are changing from resident to non-resident, they are supposed to remove the MRIC ID itself from the system."
19:29,19:34,SPEAKER_00,"If it is still present, then that is against the policy of patent."
19:34,19:36,SPEAKER_02,"Understood, got it."
19:36,19:37,SPEAKER_00,Okay.
19:39,19:45,SPEAKER_00,"And even vice versa, resident customer..."
19:46,19:47,SPEAKER_04,Okay.
19:47,19:48,SPEAKER_00,Sorry?
19:48,19:51,SPEAKER_04,"If it is a resident, then EID should be there."
19:51,19:52,SPEAKER_04,EID should be there.
19:52,20:00,SPEAKER_00,"Exactly. If it is not there, then that also should come alert to call the exchange saying that one guy is a resident but MRIC ID is not there."
20:00,20:28,SPEAKER_00,"So the thing is to perform these checks right, we are not getting any of the PI information,."
20:28,20:35,SPEAKER_00,"The customer's information into our lower environment, so not sure how we will be doing."
20:35,20:40,SPEAKER_00,"These checks, like whether EAD's number is still available or not like that."
20:40,20:46,SPEAKER_01,"How are you doing the ICD-15 alert, transaction posted in high risk account, is there a clean."
20:46,20:47,SPEAKER_01,At this rate?
20:47,20:48,SPEAKER_01,How you guys are doing that?
20:48,20:53,SPEAKER_00,"That doesn't involve any particular information right, customer's information, there we are."
20:53,20:57,SPEAKER_00,"Checking whether the account is active or dormant or diseased like that, that is…."
20:57,21:02,SPEAKER_01,"No, no, no, no, you are also checking whether transactions are happening and accounts are."
21:02,21:03,SPEAKER_01,Also not right?
21:03,21:06,SPEAKER_00,"Account information, yes, we will be getting the same."
21:06,21:07,SPEAKER_00,"See, customer speaking…."
21:07,21:10,SPEAKER_01,"Oh, you mean to say, you mean to say customer data."
21:10,21:11,SPEAKER_00,"Oh, yeah."
21:11,21:12,SPEAKER_00,Customer's information.
21:12,21:13,SPEAKER_00,"Yeah, yeah."
21:13,21:22,SPEAKER_00,"We can face the chat, we will discuss this further, okay, we might face the chat to see."
21:22,21:24,SPEAKER_00,How we can do this.
21:24,21:29,SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, the requirement you have understood right, how we can progress with that requirement."
21:29,21:30,SPEAKER_01,That we will see.
21:30,21:31,SPEAKER_00,"Okay, yeah."
21:31,21:35,SPEAKER_00,"Understood, so these are the checks at part of this contract."
21:35,21:36,SPEAKER_00,"Yeah, yeah."
21:36,21:38,SPEAKER_00,Any more checks as part of this contract?
21:38,21:41,SPEAKER_01,"Ajay bhai, anything you need to give from here?"
21:41,21:43,SPEAKER_01,"Yeah, yeah, that's it, that's it."
21:43,21:46,SPEAKER_01,"Just think if you need to add something, then we can still add."
21:46,21:48,SPEAKER_01,"Okay, I will, I will not."
21:48,21:53,SPEAKER_01,"But for timing also, these are the check points which you need to cover as part of the last."
21:53,21:55,SPEAKER_01,Contract which we have discussed.
21:55,21:56,SPEAKER_01,Got it.
21:56,22:01,SPEAKER_00,"Okay, yeah, Jasim, understood all these points, yeah, Jasim."
22:01,22:05,SPEAKER_01,"Okay, we can ask questions if you have any from your side."
22:05,22:08,SPEAKER_00,"Oh, no, Jasim, we are good, yeah."
22:08,22:09,SPEAKER_01,You are good?
22:09,22:10,SPEAKER_00,Okay.
22:10,22:11,Unknown,Yeah.
